# Videogames-EDA-AB-test-project
Project is connected to the research of key metrics and AB testig in gaming. Company key product needs to be improved.There are few datasets of user behaviour and there are few thigs to be done
  ## Goals to be done:
  1. Calculate user retention and write the function to make it more univesal
  
  2. New feature about to launch. research Revenue metrics in control and test group is required  and make a conclusion if there's an impact or not. Results of A/B testing may explain   the pattern

 ## Instruments
 - Jupyter notebook
 - Data analysys library Pandas (Python)
 - Math and statistic libraries (Mapplotlib, Scipy)
 - Visualisation libraries (Seaborn,Matplotlib)
 ## Datasets 
 - TASK 1(RETENTION): Registration data logs and authorisation data
 - Task2 (AB testing of metrics) : Revenue of control and test groups
## Resutls
### Task1:
EDA has shown presence of bad data, I managed to filter unappropriate and unnatural numbers. Function of extracting Retention is made and analysing it with cohort division methodics, one can get retention rate metrics by year, week or month
### Task 2
EDA hasn't shown any defects in data, and analysys for datesets For A/B test has shown that its more appropriate to use T-Student for ARPU and ARPPU Metrics. Additionally, we analyzed the purchase conversion rate of users in both groups. The conversion rate (CR) in the control group was 6.6% higher, and this difference was statistically significant. This means that despite the graphs, the implementation of promotions in the test group led to a decrease in purchases.
